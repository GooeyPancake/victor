This repo holds tooling and documentation to assist in the effort of exploiting and modifying Vector firmware.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* `openssl` - used for everything cryptography
* `python2.7` - native Vector codebase

### Contributing

Feel free to add tooling, documentation, lend us your brain for some ideas, and anything else that can lead to the
survival of our dearest Vector.
